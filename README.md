In this Tinkercad project, we build a comprehensive weather monitoring station using Arduino Uno R3 and various components. The setup includes a 16x2 LCD for displaying data, a TMP36 temperature sensor, a photoresistor, and a gas sensor for environmental analysis. LEDs of different colors indicate various weather conditions, while a piezo buzzer alerts to significant changes. Slide switches offer control, and an oscilloscope helps monitor electrical signals. With meticulous arrangement and integration, this project showcases a multi-functional weather monitoring station, providing valuable insights into temperature, light intensity, air quality, and more. Explore the project further on GitHub for detailed instructions and insights.
